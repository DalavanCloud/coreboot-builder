    %p Warning: Updating the firmware on your machine is inherently risky.  Changing the firmware from a vendor-produced ROM file to a third-party ROM file is even riskier.  If you are unsure of what you are doing, it is highly recommended that you get help or thoroughly research the subject before attempting to update your firmware.

    %p This website is providing a service in building a firmware package for you.  The ROM file that is produced is intended to work on the board that it is generated for, but there is NO guarantee that it will not damage the hardware it is run on. The owners of this website are not liable for any problems or issues that occur because of the use of the produced binaries, including failure to boot, bear attacks, or catastrophic failure of any device.  The people who wrote the software take even less responsibility for any issues.

      %b YOU
      are responsible for any and all issues caused by trying to replace your firmware.

    %p
      Additionally, when attempting to flash your new firmware, it is
      %b HIGHLY
      recommended that you have a full backup of your existing firmware generated by a hardware flash tool.
